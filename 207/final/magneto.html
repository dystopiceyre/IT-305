            <p>They call me a villain, a monster, but that isn't the whole story. I have only done what I've needed
            to do for the survival of mutantkind.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="box">

            <p>I watched those who hated what I am destroy my family once before.<br>
            Never again.<br>
            I have too much to lose. My children, my grandchildren, my people.<br>
            The battle has been long and hard.<br>
            When you fight fire with fire, you both end up getting get burned.<br>
            We've lost many good mutants, but I still believe we can win this.</p>
